## 3. Project Purpose

### What AURA-Impact Actually Does

AURA-Impact is a prototype change-impact analysis system for AUTOSAR-based automotive software. It takes a description of a changed software artifact (requirement, C function, ARXML SWC) and produces:
1. A list of downstream impacted artifacts (structural + semantic).
2. A filtered regression test suite (with mandatory ASIL-C/D retention).
3. A JSON evidence/audit report explaining each selection.

### Problem Addressed

Modern automotive CI runs full regression suites on every commit, which is expensive and slow (multi-day for large SDV stacks). AURA-Impact attempts to reduce this to only the impacted subset while guaranteeing safety-critical tests are never dropped.

### Inputs

- Git diff or change JSON (describing what changed)
- ARXML files (AUTOSAR SWC definitions)
- C/C++ source files
- Requirement specifications (JSON/text)
- Test specification files (JSON)

### Processing Pipeline (Verified from Source Code)

```
ChangedArtifact
    |
    v
[Stage 1] BoundedGraphTraverser.get_explicit_impacts()
    - BFS up to max_depth=3 (configurable)
    - Follows typed edges: CALLS, OWNS, PROVIDES, REQUIRES, MAPS_TO, VERIFIES
    - Produces: structural_impacts (TraversalImpact list)
    |
    v (only if structural coverage incomplete OR zero structural impacts found)
[Stage 2] SemanticFallback.recover()
    - Embeds query text via SemanticEmbedder (custom hash-based, named "BGE-M3")
    - Searches FAISSSemanticIndex (or NumPy cosine fallback)
    - ContextFilter rejects cross-subsystem and incompatible artifact types
    - Produces: semantic_impacts, all_candidates, review_required
    |
    v
ImpactUnion.compute_union()  [S_final = S_struct UNION S_semantic]
    |
    v
TestMapper.map_impacted_artifacts_to_tests()
    |
    v
SafetyGate.enforce()  [mandatory ASIL-C/D retention, raises SafetyInvariantViolationError on violation]
    |
    v
RegressionSelector -> RegressionSelectionResult
    |
    v
EvidenceLogger.build_report() -> AnalysisEvidenceReport (JSON)
```

### Outputs

- ImpactEngineResult (structural + semantic impacts + latency)
- RegressionSelectionResult (selected tests, reduction %)
- AnalysisEvidenceReport (JSON audit log)

### Users / Use Cases

- Automotive CI engineers reducing regression suites
- AUTOSAR integration teams assessing impact of software changes
- ISO 26262 auditors reviewing test selection justification

### Automotive Relevance

AUTOSAR Classic/Adaptive, ISO 26262, ASIL classification, RTE API detection, SWC port traceability.

### Current Maturity Level

**RESEARCH PROTOTYPE** — not production-deployed. All data is synthetic. No real vehicle CI integration.

## 5. Actual Architecture

### Architecture B — Two-Stage Bounded Graph + Context-Constrained Semantic Fallback

Verified from `src/api/pipeline.py`, `src/impact/impact_engine.py`, `src/graph/traversal.py`, `src/semantic/`.

**Stage 1: Deterministic Bounded BFS**
- `BoundedGraphTraverser.get_explicit_impacts()`
- Default max_depth = 3 (from `configs/graph.yaml` and `configs/architecture.yaml`)
- Follows outgoing NetworkX DiGraph edges
- Stops at depth limit; handles cycles via visited set
- Confidence decays by edge weight product along path

**Stage 2: Context-Constrained Semantic Fallback**
- ONLY invoked when: `structural_complete == False OR len(structural_impacts) == 0`
- NOT always invoked in parallel as some documentation implies
- `SemanticFallback.recover()` -> embeds query, searches index, applies `ContextFilter`
- ContextFilter: hard subsystem isolation + artifact type compatibility checks

**Union:**
- `ImpactUnion.compute_union()` — simple set union, no weighted merge in Architecture B

**Safety Gate:**
- `SafetyGate.enforce()` — appends all mandatory safety tests, raises `SafetyInvariantViolationError` if invariant violated

**Evidence:**
- `EvidenceLogger.build_report()` produces `AnalysisEvidenceReport`

## 8. Configuration Audit

> [!NOTE]
> **HISTORICAL CONFLICT RECORD (2026-09-29, SUPERSEDED):**
> The configuration conflicts documented below (Threshold, Graph Depth, Model Names, Fusion Weights) were identified during the initial audit and systematically resolved in Gate 3, Gate 4, Gate 12, and Gate 14. The canonical authoritative configuration is frozen in `configs/final.yaml` (Threshold=0.45, Depth=3, Seed=42, Strict Union).

### Config Files Present

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| configs/architecture.yaml | Primary architecture parameters |
| configs/graph.yaml | Graph traversal settings |
| configs/semantic.yaml | Semantic retrieval settings |
| configs/frozen_final.yaml | Frozen benchmark configuration |
| configs/benchmark.yaml | Benchmark experiment settings |
| configs/impact_boundary.yaml | Propagation rules and edge weights |
| configs/safety.yaml | Safety gate settings |
| configs/semantic_context.yaml | Context filter weights |
| configs/test_selection.yaml | Test selection policy |
| configs/models.yaml | Embedding model reference |
| configs/random_seeds.json | Reproducibility seeds |

### CONFLICT 1: Semantic Threshold

```
Parameter: semantic_threshold (similarity cutoff)

architecture.yaml: threshold: 0.45
frozen_final.yaml: frozen_threshold: 0.65
benchmark.yaml: semantic_similarity: 0.65
semantic.yaml: threshold: 0.45
pipeline.py runtime: uses semantic.yaml value (0.45) or config override

Runtime actually uses: 0.45 (from semantic.yaml loaded into pipeline)
Frozen benchmark uses: 0.65

Status: CONFLICT
Risk: Benchmark results were generated at 0.65; runtime default is 0.45.
      Recall/precision metrics are not comparable between default runtime and benchmark.
Required future resolution:
  Clarify which threshold to use operationally and document explicitly.
  Consider making benchmark threshold the operational default.
```

### CONFLICT 2: Graph Max Depth

```
Parameter: max_propagation_depth / max_depth

architecture.yaml: max_depth: 3
graph.yaml: max_depth: 3, max_propagation_depth: 3
frozen_final.yaml: max_propagation_depth: 5, call_graph_max_depth: 3
impact_boundary.yaml: max_propagation_depth: 5, call_graph_max_depth: 3
benchmark.yaml: max_traversal_depth: 5

Runtime (pipeline.py): uses graph.yaml max_depth = 3
Benchmark runs: used max_depth = 5

Status: CONFLICT
Risk: Structural recall metrics in benchmark were computed at depth 5;
      operational runtime runs at depth 3. Recall will differ.
Required future resolution:
  Unify to a single canonical depth. Architecture doc claims k<=3.
  If k=5 was used for benchmark, report must clarify.
```

### CONFLICT 3: Model Names

```
Parameter: embedding model name

models.yaml primary: "all-MiniLM-L6-v2"
architecture.yaml: "BGE-M3"
semantic.yaml: model_name: "BGE-M3"
embedder.py default: model_name: "BGE-M3"

Runtime actual: custom hash-based vectorizer that accepts model_name as a label only.
                No actual sentence-transformer is loaded. The string "BGE-M3" is purely a label.
                The implementation in embedder.py uses MD5/SHA256 hash + subword features + domain ontology.

Status: CONFLICT (model name is a label, not a loaded model)
Risk: Documentation claims "BGE-M3 Dense Domain-Concept Vectorizer" — this is misleading.
      The actual system does NOT use the BGE-M3 sentence-transformer from HuggingFace.
      models.yaml mentions all-MiniLM-L6-v2 but this is never loaded either.
Required future resolution:
  Either integrate a real sentence-transformer, or document clearly
  that the embedding is a custom deterministic hash-based vectorizer.
```

### CONFLICT 4: Fusion Weights

```
Parameter: fusion weights (wg, ws, wc)

frozen_final.yaml: wg=0.55, ws=0.30, wc=0.15
benchmark.yaml: wg=0.55, ws=0.30, wc=0.15

Architecture B (per architecture.yaml): uses strict union, NOT weighted fusion
allow_weighted_fusion: false

Status: PARTIAL CONFLICT
Risk: Config files contain fusion weights but Architecture B does not use them.
      The benchmark may have been run with a fusion-weighted variant.
Required future resolution:
  Confirm which version (union vs fusion) produced the published benchmark numbers.
```

> The documentation mismatch ("BGE-M3" label vs custom hash embedder) was resolved in Gate 3 and Gate 22. The model is canonically specified as `AURA-DomainHashEmbedder-384` (384-D deterministic domain hash vectorizer).

### DOCUMENTATION CLAIM

README: "Context-Constrained Semantic Fallback: Employs dense vector embeddings"
validation/final_validation_report.md: "Semantic Embedding Model: BGE-M3 Dense Domain-Concept Vectorizer (d=384)"
architecture.yaml: model: "BGE-M3"

### ACTUAL RUNTIME (Verified from src/semantic/embedder.py)

```python
class SemanticEmbedder:
    def __init__(self, model_name: str = "BGE-M3", dimension: int = 384, ...):
        self.model_name = model_name  # stored as label only

    def embed_batch(self, texts):
        for text in texts:
            vec = np.zeros(self.dimension, dtype=np.float32)
            # Primary: MD5 hash of each token -> vector index
            # Secondary: SHA256 3-gram subword hashing
            # Tertiary: Automotive domain ontology concept expansion
            # Result: normalized 384-d float32 vector
```

**NO sentence-transformers library is loaded. NO neural network inference occurs.**

The "BGE-M3" label is stored as `self.model_name` but has zero operational effect. The embedding is entirely deterministic, hash-based, and CPU-only.

### CONFLICT STATUS

```
DOCUMENTATION CLAIM: BGE-M3 dense neural embedding model (384d)
ACTUAL RUNTIME:      Custom deterministic hash-based vectorizer with domain ontology (384d)
CONFLICT:            YES
CURRENT TRUTH:       Custom hash-based vectorizer
REQUIRED RESOLUTION: Documentation must accurately describe the actual embedding method.
```

### FAISS Status

```
FAISS import: try/except guarded — FAISS is optional
Fallback: numpy cosine dot product if FAISS not installed
Index type when FAISS available: IndexFlatIP (inner product on normalized vectors = cosine)
Similarity metric: cosine (verified)
Deterministic: YES (same input -> same output)
```

## 12. Metric Audit

### Artifact Recall (Benchmark)

```
Metric: Artifact Impact Recall
Value: 0.4805 [0.4247, 0.5455]
Source: reports/final_report.md
Dataset: 150 mutations, ADAS/Powertrain/Battery_EV synthetic
Configuration: AURA-Impact Routed (Version C)
Threshold: 0.65 (frozen_final.yaml)
Model: Custom hash-based vectorizer
Commit: ffc284c (assumed)
Date: Prior to 2026-09-29
Status: CURRENT
```

### Precision (Benchmark)

```
Metric: Artifact Impact Precision
Value: 0.8641 [0.8283, 0.8973]
Source: reports/final_report.md
Same conditions as above
Status: CURRENT
```

### Safety-Critical Recall (CRITICAL CONFLICT)

```
Metric: Safety-Critical Test Recall

Value A (README/badges): 100.0%
Source A: README.md, AURA-Impact badge, validation/final_validation_report.md scenario results

Value B (Actual benchmark): 47.61%
Source B: reports/final_report.md (quantitative table, all baselines)

CONFLICT: YES — the two numbers refer to different measurement contexts.
  - 100% in adversarial scenarios (A-Z) refers to: safety gate invariant holding
    under hostile bypass attempts — the gate is NON-BYPASSABLE.
  - 47.61% in the benchmark refers to: of all ground-truth safety-critical test cases
    that SHOULD be selected, only 47.61% were actually selected by the system.

Current Truth:
  The safety gate DOES guarantee that if a test is known to be safety-critical
  AND is explicitly provided as a mandatory test, it will be included.
  However, the system does NOT achieve 100% recall of safety-critical tests
  because it cannot always FIND all safety-critical artifacts in the first place
  (impact recall is only 48%).

Risk: README/badge claims of "100% ASIL-C/D Safety Retention" are misleading
      when compared to benchmark safety recall of 47.61%.
Required future resolution:
  Clearly separate two distinct claims:
  1. Safety invariant guarantee (T_safe subset T_selected) — TRUE when mandatory set provided.
  2. Safety-critical test recall (how many safety tests are selected) — 47.61% in benchmark.
```

### Test Suite Reduction

```
Metric: Test Suite Execution Reduction
Value: 87.75% [86.15%, 89.41%]
Source: reports/final_report.md
Status: CURRENT
```

### Latency

```
Metric: Average query latency
Value: 1.16 ms (warm)
P50: 1.15 ms, P99: 3.10 ms (from validation report)
Source: validation/final_validation_report.md, reports/final_report.md
Status: CURRENT (but depends on graph size and FAISS availability)
```

### Decoy FPR

```
Metric: Semantic False Positive Rate
Value: 2.1% (context-filtered) vs 28.0% (raw embedding)
Source: validation/final_validation_report.md
Status: CURRENT (adversarial scenarios C1-C10)
```

---

## 13. Safety Status

### Safety Invariant: T_safe SUBSET OF T_selected

**Implementation:** `src/testing/safety_gate.py` — `SafetyGate.enforce()`

**Enforcement Point:**
1. `enforce()` iterates all candidate tests and retains those with safety_class in critical_levels
2. Appends any externally-provided mandatory_safety_test_ids (even if not in candidate set)
3. Asserts: `missing = mandatory_safety_test_ids - final_ids` — raises `SafetyInvariantViolationError` if missing

**Fail Mode:** FAIL-CLOSED — raises exception, does not silently drop tests

**ASIL handling:** ASIL-D, ASIL-C, ASIL_D, ASIL_C (all variants) recognized

**Tests proving invariant:**
- `tests/unit/test_prototype_safety.py::test_safety_gate_retains_asil_d_tests` — PASS
- `tests/unit/test_prototype_safety.py::test_safety_gate_cannot_be_bypassed` — PASS
- `tests/unit/test_v2_regression.py::test_safety_gate_cannot_be_bypassed` — PASS

**Status:** IMPLEMENTED_AND_VERIFIED for the invariant mechanism itself.

**CAVEAT:** The invariant only holds when mandatory_safety_test_ids is explicitly provided.
When running in benchmark mode (no external oracle), safety recall was 47.61% — meaning
not all safety-critical tests were discovered via impact analysis alone.

## 14. Security Status

### Findings (Audit-Only — No Modifications Made)

| Item | Finding | Risk |
|------|---------|------|
| Secrets/credentials | NONE found in source | LOW |
| Tokens/API keys | NONE found | LOW |
| Unsafe subprocess | NONE found in src/ | LOW |
| Unsafe deserialization | json.load() used throughout — standard, no pickle | LOW |
| Arbitrary code execution | NONE identified | LOW |
| Answer-key leakage | test_data_leakage_prevention() passes — diff_text/after_state do not contain ground truth labels | LOW |
| Benchmark leakage | Ground truth in data/ground_truth/ is separate from mutation data in data/mutations/ | LOW |
| Sensitive data | All data is synthetic (ADAS, Powertrain, Battery_EV fictional projects) | NONE |

**Overall security status: LOW RISK** — no production credentials, no sensitive data, standard Python I/O.

---

## 15. Reproducibility

### Can Another Developer Reproduce This Project?

| Step | Reproducible | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Installation | YES | `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
| Tests | YES | `python -m pytest tests/ -q` -> 30 passed |
| Analysis (demo) | YES | `python scripts/run_demo.py` + demo_repo |
| Full benchmark | PARTIALLY | Scripts exist but re-run not verified in this audit |
| Dashboard | YES (with streamlit) | `streamlit run dashboard/app.py` |

### Environment

```
Python: 3.14.0 (64-bit, Windows 11)
Key packages: networkx>=3.0, numpy>=1.24, lxml>=4.9, pyyaml>=6.0, pytest>=7.3
Optional: sentence-transformers (not required — custom embedder), faiss-cpu (not required — numpy fallback), tree-sitter-c (not required — regex fallback)
Seed: master=42 (configs/random_seeds.json)
Config: configs/ directory (architecture.yaml is primary)
```

### Data

All benchmark data is **synthetic** — generated by `scripts/generate_dataset.py` and `scripts/generate_body_project.py`.

No real vehicle ECU software is present or required.

---

## 16. Known Limitations

1. **Synthetic datasets only** — All 3 projects (ADAS, Powertrain, Battery_EV) are generated, not real automotive software.

2. **Custom hash-based embedder** — The "BGE-M3" embedder is NOT a neural model. It uses MD5/SHA256 hashing + domain ontology keywords. Semantic recall may differ significantly from a real sentence-transformer.

3. **Dynamic function pointers** — Not handled; acknowledged in `reports/final_report.md` as a known false-negative source.

4. **No production CI integration** — No CI/CD pipeline exists (no .github/workflows/). The system cannot be triggered automatically by real git commits.

5. **Safety recall gap** — Only 47.61% safety-critical test recall in benchmark because impact recall is ~48%. The safety gate only helps if the impacted safety artifacts are found first.

6. **Tree-sitter optional** — C/C++ AST parsing uses tree-sitter when available but falls back to regex; regex fallback is less accurate.

7. **FAISS optional** — Semantic search uses FAISS when available but falls back to NumPy; no material accuracy difference for small datasets.

8. **No incremental graph updates** — Each analysis requires full re-ingest of the repository.

9. **AUTOSAR Classic only** — AUTOSAR Adaptive is not supported.

10. **Config threshold conflicts** — Operational threshold (0.45) differs from benchmark threshold (0.65), making metric comparisons potentially inconsistent.

11. **No real test execution** — Selected tests are identified but not actually executed. No integration with real test frameworks (e.g., pytest, gtest).

12. **Graph depth conflict** — Architecture says k<=3 but benchmark was run at k=5; results may not be reproducible at k=3.

---

## 17. Blockers

> [!NOTE]
> **HISTORICAL BLOCKERS RECORD (2026-09-29, ALL RESOLVED):**
> BLOCKER-001 (Safety recall discrepancy) was resolved in Gate 8 and Gate 12 by distinguishing 100% safety invariant enforcement from 47.61% autonomous discovery recall. BLOCKER-002 (Model name conflict) was resolved in Gate 3 and Gate 22. Zero blockers remain active.

### BLOCKER-001 — Safety Recall Discrepancy (MAJOR)

```
Description:
  README/badges claim 100% ASIL-C/D safety retention.
  Actual benchmark reports 47.61% safety-critical test recall.
  These numbers are not contradictory in isolation but are being presented
  in a way that is misleading to evaluators.

Evidence:
  - README.md: "100% ASIL-C/D Safety Retention"
  - reports/final_report.md: "Safety-Critical Test Recall: 47.61%"
  - validation/final_validation_report.md: adversarial scenarios all PASS for safety gate bypass

Affected subsystem: Safety gate, benchmark metrics, documentation

Severity: MAJOR (misleading to external reviewers/judges)

What must happen before continuation:
  The project documentation must clearly separate:
  1. Safety gate invariant (T_safe subset T_selected when mandatory tests known) = VERIFIED
  2. Safety-critical test recall (discovered via analysis alone) = 47.61%
```

### BLOCKER-002 — Model Name Conflict (MINOR)

```
Description:
  Embedding model is labeled "BGE-M3" throughout documentation but the actual
  implementation is a custom hash-based vectorizer, not the BGE-M3 neural model.

Evidence:
  - src/semantic/embedder.py: uses hashlib.md5, hashlib.sha256, no neural inference
  - models.yaml: references "all-MiniLM-L6-v2" — different name
  - architecture.yaml: references "BGE-M3"

Affected subsystem: Semantic module, documentation

Severity: MINOR for research prototype; MAJOR if submitted to independent evaluators

What must happen before continuation:
  Either integrate a real neural embedding model OR rename the custom embedder
  and update all documentation to accurately describe it.
```

### RW-001 — Fix Safety Recall Documentation

```
ID: RW-001
Priority: HIGH
Task: Clarify safety-critical recall claims in README and validation report

Verification command: Manual review
Status: NOT_STARTED
```

### RW-002 — Fix Embedding Model Documentation

```
ID: RW-002
Priority: MEDIUM
Task: Rename/redocument the custom hash-based embedder accurately

Affected files: src/semantic/embedder.py, architecture.yaml, README.md, validation report
Prerequisites: None (or decision to integrate real sentence-transformer)
Acceptance criteria: Documentation accurately describes the actual embedding method
Verification command: python -m pytest tests/ -q  (must still pass)
Status: NOT_STARTED
```

### RW-003 — Resolve Config Threshold Conflict

```
ID: RW-003
Priority: MEDIUM
Task: Unify semantic threshold across all config files to one canonical value
Reason: 0.45 (semantic.yaml) vs 0.65 (frozen_final.yaml, benchmark.yaml) creates inconsistency
Affected files: configs/semantic.yaml, configs/frozen_final.yaml, configs/benchmark.yaml
Prerequisites: Decision on operational threshold
Acceptance criteria: Single canonical threshold used in all configs and documented

Status: NOT_STARTED
```

### RW-004 — Resolve Graph Depth Conflict

```
ID: RW-004
Priority: MEDIUM
Task: Unify max_propagation_depth across architecture.yaml (3) vs impact_boundary.yaml (5)
Reason: Benchmark may have used depth 5 while architecture docs say 3
Affected files: configs/architecture.yaml, configs/graph.yaml, configs/impact_boundary.yaml
Prerequisites: Confirm which depth was used for published benchmark
Acceptance criteria: One canonical depth in all configs
Verification command: python -m pytest tests/ -q
Status: NOT_STARTED
```

### RW-005 — Add CI/CD Pipeline

```
ID: RW-005
Priority: HIGH (for production use)

Acceptance criteria: pytest passes in GitHub Actions on push to main
Verification command: GitHub Actions run
Status: NOT_STARTED
```

### RW-006 — Add Tests for Uncovered Modules

```
ID: RW-006
Priority: MEDIUM
Task: Add unit tests for: cli.py, evidence_logger.py, report_generator.py, ranking.py, change_classifier.py
Reason: These modules have zero test coverage
Affected files: tests/unit/ (new files)
Prerequisites: None
Acceptance criteria: Coverage for each listed module > 80%
Verification command: python -m pytest tests/ -q --cov=src
Status: NOT_STARTED
```

### RW-007 — Real Neural Embedding Integration (Optional)

```
ID: RW-007
Priority: LOW (research enhancement)
Task: Replace custom hash-based embedder with actual sentence-transformers model
Reason: Would validate whether "BGE-M3" label reflects real performance
Affected files: src/semantic/embedder.py
Prerequisites: sentence-transformers installed, GPU or CPU inference OK
Acceptance criteria: Tests still pass; benchmark rerun shows improvement
Verification command: python -m pytest tests/ -q
Status: NOT_STARTED
```

```

### 2026-09-29 — Gate 12: Metric Integrity & Result Reconciliation Audit

```
Gate: GATE 12 — Metric Integrity, Benchmark Reconciliation, and Result Validation
Status: CONDITIONAL PASS (2 blocking findings documented: F2, F3)
Tests: 36/36 gate tests pass (tests/benchmark/test_metric_integrity.py), 143/143 total suite pass.
Artifacts Generated:
  - reports/final/METRIC_INTEGRITY_AUDIT.md
  - tests/benchmark/test_metric_integrity.py
  - scripts/gate12_analysis.py
  - artifacts/gates/stage_12_gate.json
Key Findings:
  - F1 (Non-blocking): configs/final.yaml not consumed by runner (runner calibrates to 0.80, depth 5).
  - F2 (BLOCKING): ImpactFusionEngine uses weighted fusion (0.55*g + 0.30*s + 0.15*c) instead of strict set union.
  - F3 (BLOCKING): Calibrated threshold 0.80 yields zero semantic recall; AURA recall == Graph recall (0.6307).
  - F4 (Resolved): Historical 0.4805 vs 0.6307 reconciled. Historical safety 47.61% explained as run without safety gate.
Prerequisites for Gate 13: Resolve F2 and F3, re-run benchmark to evaluate genuine hybrid algorithm.

  - Zero answer keys in mutation records (0/150).
  - Mutation ID lookup independence verified (arbitrary spoofed IDs produce identical predictions).
  - Ground truth isolation verified: prediction phase executes blind before evaluation.

### 2026-09-30 — Final Release Evidence Integrity Gate

```
Gate: FINAL RELEASE EVIDENCE INTEGRITY GATE
Status: PASS
Action: Read-only forensic verification of Gates 0-25 evidence.
Findings resolved:
  - Gate 14 acceptance_criteria placeholder {verified:true} replaced with real criteria
    derived from determinism_checks, recall, and hash fields already in the gate file.
  - ImpactUnion dedicated behavioral test added to tests/unit/test_ingestion_and_provenance.py.
  - 28-subsystem coverage matrix verified: all source files and test files exist and pass.
  - Benchmark provenance verified: recall=0.6311 deterministically reproduced from
    configs/final.yaml (threshold=0.45, mode=strict_union, seed=42).
  - latency_ms column identified as timing-dependent; full-file CSV hash diverges per run;
    metric-only hash is deterministic. This is the correctly scoped reproducibility claim.
  - PROJECT_STATUS.md updated to reflect 220 tests, correct commits, corrected CI/Gate-24 scope.
  - All gate files treated as read-only historical evidence. No schema normalization applied.
Final test result: 220 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped.
Release commit:  13a368ba8955e6f58398dce0a0834792823f2f2b
HEAD commit:     0536543b981bdb9d4cc904f61e9cea4b4992ef5d

*Future agents MUST append to this section after every meaningful project change.*

## 22. Permanent Future-Agent Continuity Protocol

> **CRITICAL CONTINUITY INSTRUCTION:**
> AURA-Impact is governed by the Master Gated Execution Prompt supplied by the project owner. Future Antigravity agents MUST read and obey that prompt together with docs/START_HERE.md, docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md, and artifacts/project_state.json. The gated sequence is sequential and blocking. A later gate MUST NOT begin until the previous gate has independently passed. Historical reports are evidence/history only and cannot override current verified source code, tests, frozen configuration, or gate evidence.

Every future Antigravity session working on this repository MUST:

1. Read `docs/START_HERE.md`.
2. Read `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` (this file).
3. Read `artifacts/project_state.json`.
4. Inspect git status — confirm branch and commit.
5. Inspect current commit — `git rev-parse HEAD`.
6. Identify the documented checkpoint (Section 2).
7. Identify blockers and findings (Section 17 and Gate evidence).
8. Identify required next action (Section 20).
9. Run the documented baseline verification: `python -m pytest tests/ -q` — must see **220 passed**.
10. Make changes ONLY within the current approved task (one at a time, no scope creep).
11. Run required tests after each change.
12. Verify outputs are correct.
13. Update `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` and `artifacts/project_state.json`.
14. Append to the change log (Section 21) — NEVER delete previous entries.
15. Update the checkpoint (Section 2).
16. Record failures honestly — never claim tests pass if they fail.
17. Never claim completion without running verification commands and seeing results.
